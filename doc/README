Building the documentation
==========================

For the following steps, please make sure that you've either entered the
virtual environment where the gosa classes are available or that you've
installed the gosa python packages globally.

Make sure that you have python-sphinx and python-pygments installed. If
you want to generate PDF documentation, you also need tetex and tetex-extra
in order to get a proper build out.

There are additional modules to be installed that are not part of
distributions - usually. Please install them via 'pip' into your virtual
environment:

$ pip install sphinxcontrib-spelling sphinxcontrib-email \
      sphinxcontrib-programoutput sphinxcontrib-requirements

For the command index, you need the custom **cindex** module from the
contrib directory:

$ cd contrib/cindex && ./setup.py install

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For HTML based doumentaion, run:

$ make html
$ cd _build/html
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

inside of the virutal python environment. The documentation is then ready
to serve for you on port 8080 of your current machine.


For LaTeX based (PDF) documentation, run:

$ make latex
$ cd _build/latex
$ make all-pdf

The resulting PDF file will be placed in the current directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marking TODO's:

If you need to add documentation or remember about something during the
process of writing, please mark the 'problem' like

  .. requirement::
     :status: todo
 
        Short text describing the task

so we can quickly locate these issues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spell checking:

In order to let sphinx check your wording after adding new documentation,
please run

$ sphinx-build -b spelling . _spell; less _spell/output.txt

and inspect the output in order to find usual spelling errors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you find errors or want to complete the documentation, feel free to
contact the GOsa team.
