<h2>Messaging with AMQP<a class="headerlink" href="#messaging-with-amqp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="what-is-amqp">
<h3>What is AMQP?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-amqp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>AMQP is the short form for <em>Advanced Message Queueing Protocol</em> and provides a
middleware for message oriented applications on the OSI application layer. It
provides a secure and reliable way to deliver, forward and store messages.</p>
<p>AMQP is a binary protocol which assures the interoperability between different
platforms. Size and form of messages do not matter.</p>
<p>The AMQP infrastructure consists of at least one broker - that&#8217;s the instance
where messages get processed - and a number of clients. These clients can publish
or consume messages. Clients wich consume messages are named <em>consumer</em> and
clients publishing messages are named <em>producer</em>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="queues">
<h3>Queues<a class="headerlink" href="#queues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The base for communication with messages are so called <em>queues</em>. Messages in
queues get stored in memory or on disk and will be transferred (in sent order
if applicable) to the consumers. Queues are message store and distribution
unit in one. Message queues do not depend on each other and can have different
properties: private or public, permanent or temporary, permanent or volatile.
These properties make a determination whether the queue implements a store-and-forward,
a pub-sub or what ever mechanism.</p>
<p>If you compare queues to SMTP, the queues would be like post boxes. The mail
sender is a producer and a mail filter the consumer.</p>
<p>Queues can be configured to realize one-to-one, one-to-any, point-to-point and
publish-subscribe mechanisms. For members of the AMQP network, it may be
interresting if a disk of a connected system is running out of space. In this
case you can create some kind of status queue which is taking your systems
disk status messages. Interrested consumers can inspect incoming messages and
trigger an automatic cleanup or send a short message to the administrator.</p>
<p>Queues can be mirrored on different brokers in a cluster - while this kind of
clustering is called <em>federation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exchange">
<h3>Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#exchange" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An exchange is an instance of the AMQP concept, which can connect queues
by several criteria - it provides some kind of routing mechanism for
messages. The process of connecting queues is called <em>binding</em>.</p>
<p>AMQP provides a couple of exchanges. One way would be to assign messages
and queues be the routing key, or by using an XQuery for XML based
messages.</p>
<p>Clacks itself uses two kinds of exchanges: the XML exchange for events, to
allow dedicated filtering and the routing key based exchange to provide
round robin command queues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="messages">
<h3>Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sent information consists of AMQP header information and the message body.
The contents of the message body is not specified - if you want to you can
transport DVD images via AMQP. In case of Clacks the message body consists
either of XML messages or JSON encoded RPC calls.</p>
<p>The &#8216;configuration&#8217; on how to transport messages is done by the header
specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="broker">
<h3>Broker<a class="headerlink" href="#broker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently, one of the biggest drawbacks of AMQP is that there are different
specifications in different states of development available. While there&#8217;s
a version 1.0 of AMQP available now, there&#8217;s no broker which is implementing
it right now. There are brokers to support 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 etc. and all of
them tend to be not 100% compatible to each other.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an (incomplete) excerpt of available OSS and non OSS brokers:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>OpenAMQ</strong></p>
<p>This free broker has been developed by the former creators of AMQP. It&#8217;s
done in <em>C</em> and supports interresting features like REST based messaging.
Sadly it looks like they&#8217;ve abandoned OpenAMQ and the company behind it
(iMatix) seems to focus on <em>0mq</em> - another messaging system.</p>
<p>OpenAMQ only supports older versions of the AMQP standard.</p>
<p>OpenAMQ does not support any authentication or authorization mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>RabbitMQ</strong></p>
<p>RabbitMQ is a free broker done in <em>Erlang</em>. It&#8217;s maintained by Rabbit
Technologies Ltd.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, they only supports older versions of the AMQP standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>QPID</strong></p>
<p>QPID is a free broker under the hood of the apache project. They provide
a <em>C</em> and a <em>Java</em> based broker. It supports SASL based authentication and
access control to queues.</p>
<p>They support content based filtering via XQuery and it seems to be the most
up-to-date broker in concerns of AMQP specifications.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Red Hat Enterprise MRG</strong></p>
<p>This is the commercial version of QPID, maintained by RedHat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Clacks is using the <em>C</em> broker of QPID, because it makes life easier in several
places.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="authentication">
<h3>Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using QPID, we can rely on a SASL based authentication wich can be simply
connected to the LDAP directory infrastructure. The authorization itself
must be done by Clacks, because the QPID acl concept is not dynamic - mostly
for reasons of performance.</p>
<p>The AMQP broker can automatically store the authentication information in
the AMQP headers, so that Clacks is able to notice who&#8217;s sending messages.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="clacks-overview">
<h2>Clacks overview<a class="headerlink" href="#clacks-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This overview should provide a big picture of the Clacks components and describes
the tasks the components are supposed to do. More detailed information can be
found in the developer documentation.</p>
<div class="section" id="domains">
<h3>Domains<a class="headerlink" href="#domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Systems connected with Clacks components shape a so called domain. If you like
the analogy, you can compare a Clacks domain to a Windows domain: it keeps some
kind of information about a delimited area of an organization (or in your
opinion the world).</p>
<p>A domain is basically constructed of a reverse DNS name - i.e. the default
domain is <em>org.clacks</em>, but it could be <em>de.gonicus</em> or whatever you want it
to be. AMQP queues are based on the domain, so if you use the default, all
created queues start with <em>org.clacks.</em> and shape the namespace to use in AMQP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clacks-common">
<h3>clacks.common<a class="headerlink" href="#clacks-common" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>clacks.common</em> component is the base library which is providing common
functionality to agents and clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clacks-agent">
<h3>clacks.agent<a class="headerlink" href="#clacks-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For every domain, you need at least on broker (or a broker federation) and
at least one <em>clacks.agent</em> instance. The agent defines the domain queues and
puts life to queues by answering to command requests and processing basic
events.</p>
<p>If you have more than one agent, they share the command queues using a round
robin method of the AMQP broker - so you&#8217;ve automatic load balancing. Agents
notify each other on a regular base in order to know each others status (load,
number of workers, etc.). They also notify each other if they&#8217;re joining or
leaving the domain - maybe due to a service restart. Because <em>clacks.agent</em>
instances can have different plugins loaded, they also inform each others
about their capabilities - so that in case it&#8217;s needed - commands can be
forwarded to a capable agent.</p>
<p>All commands are registered in the CommandRegistry and can be simply accessed
from there.</p>
