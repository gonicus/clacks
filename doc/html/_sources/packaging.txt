Packaging
*********

The documentation should expose the most important steps to get packages for your
favorite distribution. Packaging help is appreciated - we're a little bit Debian
focused ;-)


Ubuntu / Debian
===============

In the moment, there's contributed packaging stuff inside of the ``contrib/packaging/debian``
directory. The following package stubs are available:

 * clacks

   It is possible to generate all files needed for packaging out of
   the *git* tree. Just call *package.sh* in the *clacks* directory. It
   will create an *orig.tar.gz* and a *.dsc* file.


RPM based distributions
=======================

There is no packaging done yet.
