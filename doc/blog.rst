We're proud to present the *Clacks Framework* release *0.8*, which is
an important step towards version *1.0* next year. Clustering features
are disabled in this release, but there's an interesting preview for
the new **Qooxdoo** based GOsa included.

Take a look at :ref:`documentation` to learn about the software architecture
or take a look at the `Demo <http://demo.gonicus.de/clacks.html>`_ to play
with the beginnings of the GOsa GUI.
