The *AMQPService* is responsible for connecting the *agent* to the AMQP
bus, registers the required queues, listens for commands on that queues
and dispatches incoming commands to the
:class:`clacks.agent.command.CommandRegistry`.

.. _agent-queues:

**Queues**

In order to use features like round robin and automatic routing of commands
to agents that are capable of handling them, the AMQPService creates a
queue structure that addresses these facts.

Queues are named after the configured *domain* - i.e. if you use the
configured default domain, you'll get ``org.clacks`` as the base dot
separated string for the queues. The agent registers two **core** queues:

 * **{domain}.command.core** *(i.e. org.clacks.command.core)*

   This is a round robin queue that is shared by all agents joining
   the domain. The core queue must only handle commands that are provided
   by all agents.

 * **{domain}.command.core.{nodename}** *(i.e. org.clacks.command.core.node1 if your node is named node1)*

   This queue is a private queue that is only used by a specific
   agent. It is possible to direct a command to exactly the agent identified
   by *nodename*.

The same thing which is established for the **command.core** queues is done
for queues registered by certain plugins. This ensures that commands are only
delivered to nodes which provide that functionality by listening to these
queues:

 * **{domain}.command.{plugin}** *(i.e. org.clacks.command.goto)*

   This is a round robin queue that is shared by all agents joining
   the domain. In the example above, all agents providing the *goto* plugin
   will share this queue.

 * **{domain}.command.{plugin}.nodename** *(i.e. org.clacks.command.goto.node1 if your node is named node1)*

   Like for the *command.core* queues, this queue is private for the current
   agent and makes it possible to direct a command to exactly the agent identified
   by *nodename*.

.. note::

    To learn how to specify the plugin's target queue, please read `Plugins <plugins>`_
    for more information.

Last but not least, the *AMQPService* binds to the queues mentioned above
and dispatches command calls to the *CommandRegistry*.
