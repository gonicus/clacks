class Plugin(object):
    """
    The Plugin object is just a marker in the moment: it lacks special
    code. While being a marker, there's a mandatory class member that must
    be maintained by users: ``_target_``

    The ``_target_`` class member determines what queue the plugin will be
    registered on. The target queue is assembled by the GOsa *domain* and
    the *_target_*. Plugins that do not offer common functionality should
    register on something else than *core*.

    In this example, we create a sample plugin which is listening on
    ``<domain>.sample`` (domain is *org.gosa* if you didn't change the
    configuration), which makes it possible that only agents having this
    module installed get related messages::

        >>> from gosa.common import Environment
        >>> from gosa.common.components import Command, Plugin
        >>>
        >>> class SampleModule(Plugin):
        ...     _target_ = 'sample'
        ...
        ...     @Command(__help__=N_("Return a pre-defined message to the caller"))
        ...     def hello(self, name="unknown"):
        ...         return _("Hello %s!") % name

    """
