[replace]
# This section defines some replace rules for phone numbers. They are applied
# in order as they appear here before the resulting number is searched in the
# CRM. A replace rule is a combination of a match pattern, in form of a regular
# expression, and a replace string, containing references to the match groups of
# the pattern. The syntax is:
# 
# some_label =  "pattern", "replace rule"
#
# E.g.:
# test = "^\\+[0-9]{2}([0-9]*)", "0\1"
# This example replaces a leading country code with 0. So +491234567890
# would be changed to 01234567890.
